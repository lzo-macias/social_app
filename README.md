#Shenanigram

Deployment Link: https://shenanigram.netlify.app/

We wanted to build a platform that integrates both text and image-based content while allowing users to manage their posts effectively. This project helped us explore user authentication, media storage, and dynamic content rendering

Navigation
Home page with user authentication.
Personal feed where users can see their posts.

Creating a Post
Users can write a post, upload an image, or provide an image URL.
Posts appear instantly in their personal feed.

Editing & Deleting Posts
Users can edit the text of a post and update the image.
Posts can be deleted if they are no longer needed.

Image Upload & Library
Users can upload images, which are stored in their personal image library.

Admin Features
Admins can manage posts, moderate content, and review user activity.

Backend: Node.js + Express (for handling API requests)
Database: PostgreSQL (structured data storage)
Authentication: JWT + Bcrypt (secure user authentication)
Styling: CSS/Tailwind (for responsive design)
File Uploads: Multer (for handling images)
Why did we choose these technologies?
React updates UI efficiently.
Node & Express provide a scalable backend.
